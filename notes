setup a very react-like enviroment with npm. Need to read more on the similarities and differences between yarn and npm 

You now have a Node development environment up and running on your computer that can be used for 
creating Express web applications. You've also seen how NPM can be used to import Express into an 
application, and also how you can create applications using the Express Application Generator tool 
and then run them.

In the next article we start working through a tutorial to build a complete web application using 
this environment and associated tools.
